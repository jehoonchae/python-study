       "('Growth in Chinas manufacturing sector sputtered in September as both external and domestic demand weakened two surveys showed on Sunday raising the pressure on policymakers as U.S. tariffs appear to be inflicting a heavier toll on the Chinese economy.\\n\\nA private survey showed growth in the factory sector stalled after 15 months of expansion with export orders falling the fastest in over two years while an official survey confirmed a further manufacturing weakening.\\nTaken together the business activity gauges  the first major readings on Chinas economy for September  confirm consensus views that the worlds secondlargest economy is continuing to cool which is likely to prompt Chinese policymakers to roll out more growthsupport measures in coming months.\\n\\nWe should make policy preparations as the external pressure on the economy is rising and it will increase further next year said Tang Jianwei senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai.\\n\\nSome cushion for the slowing economy might come from services which account for more than half of Chinas economy. The official nonmanufacturing Purchasing Managers Index PMI released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday showed services expanded at a faster rate in September.\\n\\nFor manufacturing the official index fell to a sevenmonth low of 50.8 in September from 51.3 in August and below a Reuters poll forecast of 51.2. That index has stayed above the 50point mark which divides expansion from contraction 26 straight months.\\n\\nBut the CaixinMarkit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index PMI fell more than expected to 50.0 from 50.6 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 50.5 on average.\\n\\nFor the private survey September was the first time Chinas factories had not seen business improve since May 2017 when activity contracted.\\n\\nShrinking new export orders\\nThe official data covers a much larger number of companies while the private poll focuses more on small and mediumsized firms which are vital to Chinas job creation. Chinese officials have pledged to prevent extensive jo losses as trade risks mount.\\n\\nIn the Caixin survey new export orders  an indicator of future activity contracted at the fastest pace since February 2016 with companies attributing the shrinking orders to trade frictions and subsequent tariffs.\\n\\nIn the official survey the new export orders subindex fell to 48.0 from 49.4 in August contracting for a fourth straight month.\\n\\nExpansion across the manufacturing sector weakened in September as exports increasingly dragged down performance and continued softening demand began to have an impact on companies production said Zhengsheng Zhong director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.\\n\\nDownward pressure on Chinas economy was significant said Zhong.\\n\\nTang of Bank of Communications said he expects Chinas economic growth to slow to 6.6 percent in the third quarter from 6.7 percent in AprilJune.\\n\\nLong fight ahead?\\nThe Trump administration has pointed to growing signs of economic weakness in China and its slumping stock markets as proof that the United States is winning the trade war but Beijing has remained defiant vowing to stimulate domestic demand to cushion the blow from any trade shocks. Washington slapped tariffs on 200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 24 and is threatening to impose duties on virtually all of the goods China exports to the United States.\\n\\nPlans for fresh trade talks collapsed in recent weeks and both sides appear to be digging in for a long fight casting a pall over the outlook for global economic growth.\\n\\nLong Guoqiang deputy head of the Chinese Cabinets think tank the Development Research Centre told reporters on Sunday the impact of the tariffs on some exporters would be harsh.\\n\\nSome will cut production some will cut workers and some may even shut down Long said.\\n\\nWhile Chinas official export data has proved surprisingly resilient so far many analysts believe companies have been rushing out shipments to the United States to beat successive rounds of tariffs raising the risk of a sharp drop off once duties are actually imposed. The deepening slump in export orders may be bearing that theory out.\\n\\nExportreliant Chinese cities and provinces are already showing the strain.\\n\\nGuangdong Chinas biggest province by gross domestic product reported a drop in exports in the first eight months from a year earlier.\\n\\nDemand in China had already been slowing before the U.S. trade row flared a multiyear crackdown on riskier lending and debt started to push up companies borrowing costs. Fixedasset investment growth has sunk to a record low.\\n\\nPolicymakers have shifted focus in recent months to growth boosting measures to cushion the economy and weather the trade storm. They have sought to bring financing costs down boost lending to smaller businesses cut taxes and fasttrack more infrastructure projects.\\n\\nBut analysts note it will take some time for such measures to put a floor under the slowing economy with some predicting things will get worse before they get better.\\n\\nChina is likely to place increased hopes on its services sector with rising wages for people in it giving consumers more spending power. The official PMI index for September put services at 54.9 the highest level since June from 54.2 in August.\\n\\nThe central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios three times this year to pump out more liquidity with more reductions widely expected.',\n",
